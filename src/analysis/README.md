# Analysis
## Type of analysis
The relationship between the metric dependent variable 'annual revenue' and the 24 independent variables was examined by multiple linear regression. Thus, we can take into account all the important factors and get a precise understainding of the relationship between each individual factor and the expected annual revenue of an Airbnb. 

## Check assumptions
To visually check the assumptions required for regression analysis, a few plots have been created using the following codechunk:

### Linearity

### Normality

### Homoscedasticity

## Regression analysis
After creating the data set and checking the assumptions, a (regression) analysis was conducted.
